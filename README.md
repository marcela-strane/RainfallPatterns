# RainfallPatterns
This is the python code associated with our GIS project here: https://harris-county-rainfall-patterns-uh1.hub.arcgis.com/edit .
This looks at Harris County Rainfall Events for the first two weeks of January 2017. This was created with the intention of looking at rainfall patterns in Harris County across decades.
